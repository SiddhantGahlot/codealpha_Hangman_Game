# Hangman Game - Python GUI Project

## Overview
**This is a Python-based Hangman Game with a cricket theme, built using Tkinter for the GUI. Players attempt to guess cricket-related words, with hints provided for each word. The game features an animated hangman figure that updates with every incorrect guess and a restart button to reset the game at any time.**

## Features
- **Cricket-Themed Words: The game includes a wide variety of cricket-related terms, each with a hint to help players guess the word.**
- **Interactive GUI: Built using the Tkinter library, offering a clean and responsive user interface.**
- **Hangman Animation: The hangman figure updates dynamically based on the number of wrong guesses.**
- **Hints Provided: Every word has a hint displayed, giving players a clue about the word.**
- **Restart Functionality: A "Restart Game" button allows players to start a new game at any time.**

## Game Rules
- **You have 6 attempts to guess the word.**
- **For each wrong guess, part of the hangman figure appears.**
- **A hint is provided to help you guess the word.**
- **You win if you guess all the letters before the hangman is fully drawn.**
- **If the hangman is completed before you guess the word, the game is over.**

## How to Play
- **Enter a letter in the text field and press Enter (or click the Restart Game button to reset).**
- **If the letter is correct, it will fill in the corresponding blanks in the word.**
- **If incorrect, you lose one attempt, and the hangman figure will start to appear.**
- **Keep guessing until you either win by guessing all the letters or lose by running out of attempts.**
